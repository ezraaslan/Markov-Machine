# Markov-Machine
This is my first try at a computationally efficient text-generation algorithm. Contrary to LLMs, this lightweight program uses Markov Chains and other rules of probability to analyze relationships between words in inputted text. It uses this to reform sentences and paragraphs in order to generate a new format from the original corpus.
